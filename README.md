# IE_MBD_2020

- This repository contains all the projects implemented during my Master's in Business Analytics & Big Data program while at IE University during October 2019 - July 2020

# [Data Visualization (R - ggplot)](https://github.com/BegonaFrigolet/Data-Visualization_R_Library_ggplot)
- Data of CO2 emissions with a focus on new cars in the UK, the study will focus on a dataset of newly sold cars in the United Kingdom from 2000 to 2013.
- The emphasis will be on CO2 emissions from those cars and other related variables.

- To review the report and code it is recommended to download the HTML file:

# [Data Visualization (D3)](https://github.com/BegonaFrigolet/Data-Visualization_D3.js)
The purpose of this project is to transform the data presented in a bar chart into something more interactive while at the same time keeping the main message. To be able to come up with this final result, We combined various sources with the main ones being a tutorial from FlowingData showing us of to do such a visualization.([the link to the tutorial i] (https://flowingdata.com/2016/08/23/make-a-moving-bubbles-chart-to-show-clustering-and-distributions/) and a graph tweeted by Caitlin Huton.

Data:
The data of the animation can be found in this Link

Final Visualization:
The result with animations can be found in this Link, to learn more about D3 it is recommended to go through the explanations as well as the visualizations.

# [Spark](https://github.com/BegonaFrigolet/SPARK)
- A look into Hotels Reviews:
- The Business world has had a drastically change since the introduction of online companies and their digitalization model in which the largest taxi company does not own cars, the most popular owner does not create their own content and the largest accommodation providers owns no real state.
- Methology: The original data was scraped by Booking.com and they are the owners of the data, for this analysis 2017 was taken into consideration.Through a Virtual Machine and using Spark, data transformations were done with the help of the “PySpark” library.
